"""
    In the word graphs, each vertex represents a five-letter word of English.
    For $k âˆˆ {1,2}$, an edge joins $u$ and $v$ if the corresponding words are anagrams, or if they differ in exactly $k$ positions.
    For instance ``begin'' and ``binge'' are neighbours, and so are ``turns'' and ``terns'' for $k=1$.

    The word graphs  come in two flavours.
    The *rusty word* graphs are guaranteed to include ``begin,'' ``ender,'' and ``rusty.''
    The vertex corresponding to ``rusty'' is coloured red, no other vertices are red.

    The filenames are "rusty-$k$-$n$".
