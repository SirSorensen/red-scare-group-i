"""
    The Grid graphs consist of $N^2$ vertices that represent integer coordinates $(x,y)$ for $x,y âˆˆ {0, ..., N-1}$.
    Each vertex $(x,y)$ is connected to $(x-1,y)$, $(x,y-1)$, and $(x-1,y-1)$, provided that these vertices exist.
    The red vertices form a maze-like structure in the graph:
    Every second row is red, except for the top- or bottommost vertex, alternatingly.
    There is a unique $s,t$-path avoiding all red vertices, and a shortest alternating path following the diagonal.

    Grid graphs of various sizes are represented by "grid-$N$-0".
    Each of these graphs comes with two variants.
    In "grid-$N$-1", some random red vertices have turned non-red (so there are `holes' in the hedges).
    In "grid-$N$-2", some random non-red vertices have turned red (so some passages are blocked).
