<h2>Introduction</h2>	
This repository is for the [Red Scare](https://learnit.itu.dk/mod/assign/view.php?id=208004) project for the course "Algorithm Design, MSc CS (Autumn 2024)" at the IT University in Copenhagen.


<h2>How to run the program</h2>	

To run the program, go to the `src` folder with your terminal.\
`cd src`

Now, in `src\main.py`, change the `file_name`-variable to the name of the data-input from the `data`folder in the project (i.e. "G-ex" for `data/G-ex.txt`).

In your terminal, run the following command:\
`python main.py`

Now you should have succesfully run the program!

<h2>How to update Overleaf submodule</h2>

In your terminal, write the following:\
`git submodule update --init --recursive`


If you are prompted for username and password, the username is "git" and the password is your "Git authentication token" from Overleaf (you should be able to find it on overleaf.com -> account).
