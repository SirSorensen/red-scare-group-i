<h2>How to run the program</h2>	

To run the program, go to the `src` folder with your terminal.\
`cd src`

Now, in `src\main.py`, change the `file_name`-variable to the name of the data-input from the `data`folder in the project (i.e. "G-ex" for `data/G-ex.txt`).

In your terminal, run the following command:\
`python main.py`

Now you should have succesfully run the program!
